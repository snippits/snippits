# Snippit
This is the main repo of snippit, containing various of tools and repos. Please use this to make sure the versions of all submodules are in consistent.

The current versoin of __Snippits__ is __0.15.2__, the expected release date of version-1.0 is around the end of April, 2017.
# Features of 1.0
1. Multi-core emulation
2. Function call stack tracking
3. Robust phase detection for general program
4. Phase bottleneck analysis
5. Heterogeneous-friendliness prediction
6. FBT (Function Boundary Tracing) callbacks (Similar to DTrace)
7. TBA

# Important Requirements
* gcc/g++ version >= __4.9__
* [Highly recommand] clang/clang++ LLVM
* ARM cross compiler gcc/g++ version >= 4.8 [linaro gcc 4.9](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/4.9-2016.02/arm-linux-gnueabi/gcc-linaro-4.9-2016.02-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi.tar.xz).
* Beta version supports only ARM target system. x86 would be supported in the future.

# Usage
1. Run `./prepare.sh` to set up the working environment
2. Run `source ./install_command.sh` to get snippit command and completions
3. Run `./demo.sh` to run a demo of snippit

# Snippit command
The __snippit command__ can be executed at any working directory. The command leads
other sub-commands to perform the actions easier.
The current version has only one sub-command, qemu.
Sample usages are:
1. `snippit qemu vexpress`
2. `snippit qemu -o ./demo vexpress`

# Change window size
Sometime the windows size (granularity) would affect the results and make it hard to read.
Adjusting the window size is a way to inspect your code. Future version would be able to
adjust window size offline. The current version can only do this when running program.
Window size is assigned by environment variable in the unit of kilo instructions.
Ex:
* 200k instructions (default size) `PHASE_WINDOW_SIZE=200 snippit qemu vexpress`
* 500k instructions `PHASE_WINDOW_SIZE=500 snippit qemu vexpress`

One can also assign __env__ at any script.
Ex:
* `PHASE_WINDOW_SIZE=200 make execute -j8` in __qemu_vpmu/build__
* `PHASE_WINDOW_SIZE=100 ./runQEMU.sh vexpress` in __qemu_image__
